Image generation using GANs and VAE models

Images for Cartoon and Logos dataset are generated using Deep generative models.
1) Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)
2) Variational Auto Encoder. 

The File structures : 
1) Python Script contains : 
    Code for Pre-processing Cartoon Dataset.
    Code for Pre-processing Logos Dataset.
    Implementation of GANs using Google Colab - Tensorflow.
    Implementation of VAEs using Google Colab - Tensorflow.

2) Output Folders: 
   Contains the output for images with dataset of 30k and 60k images (k denotes Thousand)
   
3) Report: 
   Contains the detailed report from research to implementation for Both the models. This thesis is focused mainly on image generation using GANs and VAEs. Also, Comparative study    for the both the generative model is discussed.
